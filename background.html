Subrahmanyam aka Subbu aka Subhash is the youngest son of a family. He is a wastrel and gypsy and spends his days roaming around with girls, hanging around with his friends, and constantly failing his exams. Subbu's behavior always shows hatred and disgust towards his father, Viswanadh, who is a cafe owner. Subbu's elder brother, Chakri, on the other hand is a college level kickboxer and Viswanadh's favorite son. Chakri spends his days rigorously training for the inter college kickboxing championship, but ends up losing to his kickboxing arch rival, Rohit, who is from the elite Model College. While training, he and Rohit end up running into each other and Chakri always is shamed for his poor background as Chakri attends Government College. Jaanu aka Janaki is Subbu's neighbor and secretly in love in Subbu. Subbu is unaware that Jaanu is in love with him. Subbu usually considers Jaanu as a source of money and cars to impress girls and constantly borrows money and cars. Jaanu's father is a garage owner.

One day, Subbu meets Lovely, who is a rich college girl from the elite Model College, and lies that he attends the elite Engineering College and a wealthy man's son. Subbu is actually from the local government college just like his brother Chakri. Lovely falls for his lies and soon begins to express her love to Subbu. Eventually, she learns the truth and breaks up and insults Subbu in front of Viswanadh and Chakri. At the same time, Viswanadh finds out that Subbu has taken large amounts of Jaanu. Fatigued with his behavior, Viswanadh kicks out Subbu and disowns him.

Subbu is now homeless and gets support from Jaanu. Jaanu tells Subbu that he should be more responsible of himself and prove himself towards his father. He begins to reform himself and soon starts to understand the love of Jaanu. In the meantime, Chakri is attacked and seriously injured by Rohit, who now happens to be Lovely's new boyfriend and Subbu's enemy, and his friends causing Chakri to be hospitalized. This rules him out of the final match of the inter college kick boxing championship. Deciding to seek revenge and redeem himself in front of Viswanadh's eyes, Subbu trains and works really hard to prepare for the inter college kickboxing championship. He defeats Rohit in the kickboxing match and wins the final intercollege kickboxing championship, dedicates the trophy to Chakri, redeems himself to Visnwanadh, and finally accepts Jaanu's love.</p>
